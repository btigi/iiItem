+) Section 1. About
===================
  The iiItem Mod adds several dozen new items to the game, concentrating on lesser known item types (such as potions, bracers, arrows etc). The mod does not (currently) add any upgradable items, item parts or smiths. Game balance has been taken into account during item creation, and over-powered items have (hopefully) been avoided - there are no +5 katanas!

Items are scattered throughout the game world; being added to creature inventories and stores (none of the new items are currently added to area containers). 'Unique' items (i.e. items with a specific individual history) are added only to stores. iiItem should be installed after mods which add new creatures or stores, to ensure that the new items are scattered equally through the game, and not just added to the stock game files.

When installing onto Tutu, the player is presented with an extra option - whether to install 'flavour items'. These are items that have no immediate use in Tutu (such as weapons with bonus damage against Yuan-ti, which don't exist in Tutu, and anti-level drain items, which have no use in BG1), though they may add to the 'flavour' of the game - not everything exists to be used by the Protagonist, right then and there.

NOTE: The installation makes heavy use of randomness, meaning that items will not always be available in the same places, or in the same amounts. The use of this randomness means there is a very small chance that not all of the items will be added to the game for any given installation.


+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
The iiItem Mod is distributed using the WeiDU distribution package. To install, unzip the iiItem(xx).zip file (where xx represents the version number of the release), to the BG2 main directory. Then run the "Setup-iiItem.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts. 

To uninstall re-run the "Setup-iiItem.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts, selecting "Uninstall" as required.
