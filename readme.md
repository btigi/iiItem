# iiItem

The iiItem Mod adds several dozen new items to the game, concentrating on lesser known item types (such as potions, bracers, arrows etc). The mod does not (currently) add any upgradable items, item parts or smiths. Game balance has been taken into account during item creation, and over-powered items have (hopefully) been avoided - there are no +5 katanas!

Items are scattered throughout the game world; being added to creature inventories and stores (none of the new items are currently added to area containers). 'Unique' items (i.e. items with a specific individual history) are added only to stores. iiItem should be installed after mods which add new creatures or stores, to ensure that the new items are scattered equally through the game, and not just added to the stock game files.
